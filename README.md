# macos-speech-server

Local, private speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) server for macOS with OpenAI-compatible and Home Assistant (Wyoming) support.

Runs entirely on-device using Apple's Neural Engine via [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio) -- no cloud services, no API keys, no data leaves your machine. Models are loaded once at startup and served to any device on your network, so a single Mac with Apple Silicon can handle transcription and speech for your entire household.

Two interfaces, one server:

- **OpenAI-compatible HTTP API** -- drop-in replacement for OpenAI audio endpoints (`/v1/audio/transcriptions`, `/v1/audio/speech`)
- **[Wyoming protocol](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming)** (TCP, default port 10300) -- native [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) voice pipeline integration

## Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Swift 6.2+
- Apple Silicon recommended (Neural Engine acceleration)

## Quick start

```bash
swift build
swift run speech-server
```

On first launch, ASR and TTS models are downloaded automatically. This takes several minutes but only happens once; subsequent starts are fast.

The server listens on `http://localhost:8080` by default. The Wyoming protocol server listens on TCP port `10300` by default.

## Configuration

All server settings can be customised via a YAML config file. Create `speech-server.yaml` in the working directory (a fully-commented example is included in the repo):

```yaml
log_level: notice     # trace | debug | info | notice | warning | error | critical

servers:
  http:
    host: 127.0.0.1       # use your LAN or Tailscale IP to accept connections from other devices
    port: 8080
    upload_limit_mb: 500
  wyoming:
    host: 127.0.0.1       # can differ from http.host; set independently
    port: 10300           # TCP port for Wyoming protocol (Home Assistant). 0 = disabled.

stt:
  engine: parakeet      # parakeet (default) | qwen3 | nemotron
  parakeet:
    model_version: v3   # v3 = multilingual (25 langs, default), v2 = English-only
  # qwen3:              # Qwen3 ASR — encoder-decoder model with language hinting (macOS 15+)
  #   variant: int8     # int8 (default, ~900 MB) | f32 (~1.75 GB)
  #   language: en      # ISO 639-1 code; omit for auto-detect
  # nemotron:           # Nemotron multilingual streaming ASR (~40 langs, macOS 15+, Apple Silicon)
  #   language: en-US   # FLEURS-style code (en-US, fr-FR, …); omit for auto-detect
  #   chunk_ms: 1120    # 560 | 1120 (default) | 2240 | 4480

tts:
  engine: pocket_tts    # pocket_tts (default) | avspeech | kokoro

  # AVSpeech settings (only used when engine: avspeech)
  # avspeech:
  #   default_voice: Samantha   # Short name or full identifier; nil = system locale default
  #   sample_rate: 22050        # Native AVSpeech output rate (Hz)

  # Kokoro TTS settings (only used when engine: kokoro)
  # kokoro:
  #   default_voice: af_heart   # Any Kokoro voice ID (e.g. af_heart, am_adam); default af_heart
```

All fields are optional — omitted fields use the defaults shown above.

### STT engines

Three STT engines are available:

| Engine | `engine:` value | Languages | Downloads | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Parakeet TDT | `parakeet` | 25 (v3) or English-only (v2) | ~500 MB on first start | Default, CTC/TDT model, word-level timestamps |
| Qwen3 ASR | `qwen3` | 30+ with explicit language hinting | ~900 MB (int8) or ~1.75 GB (f32) | Encoder-decoder, macOS 15+ required |
| Nemotron | `nemotron` | ~40 with explicit language hinting | ~600 MB on first start | Multilingual streaming, macOS 15+ and Apple Silicon required |

#### `parakeet` (default)

Uses [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio)'s Parakeet TDT model (based on NVIDIA's architecture). Supports word-level timestamps and VAD-based segmentation. Two model versions: `v3` (multilingual, 25 languages) and `v2` (English-only, higher recall).

#### `qwen3` — encoder-decoder ASR with language hinting

Uses FluidAudio's Qwen3 ASR model — an encoder-decoder architecture (Whisper-family) that supports explicit language hinting via the `language` setting. This can improve accuracy for specific accents or languages since the model doesn't need to auto-detect the language. Requires macOS 15+.

```yaml
stt:
  engine: qwen3
  qwen3:
    variant: int8     # int8 (default, ~900 MB) or f32 (~1.75 GB)
    language: en      # ISO 639-1 code — set this for best results with a known language
```

Supported languages: zh, en, yue, ar, de, fr, es, pt, id, it, ko, ru, th, vi, ja, tr, hi, ms, nl, sv, da, fi, pl, cs, fil, fa, el, hu, mk, ro.

**Note:** Qwen3 does not provide word-level timestamps. The `verbose_json` response will include segment-level timing (from VAD) but the `words` array will be empty.

#### `nemotron` — multilingual streaming ASR

Uses FluidAudio's `StreamingNemotronMultilingualAsrManager` (NVIDIA Nemotron, ~40 languages). Like Qwen3 it accepts an explicit `language` hint (FLEURS-style code, e.g. `en-US`, `fr-FR`, `zh-CN`); omit it for auto-detection. The model is a streaming recognizer, so the server feeds each file through it and collects the final transcript. Requires macOS 15+ and Apple Silicon.

```yaml
stt:
  engine: nemotron
  nemotron:
    language: en-US   # FLEURS-style code — set this for best results with a known language
    chunk_ms: 1120    # latency/throughput tier: 560 | 1120 (default) | 2240 | 4480
```

`chunk_ms` selects the model build: smaller chunks lower latency, larger chunks raise throughput (WER-neutral). Supported languages include en, es, de, fr, it, pt, nl, sv, da, no, fi, pl, cs, ru, uk, ar, fa, he, hi, bn, ta, te, th, vi, id, ms, ja, ko, zh, tr, and more (~40 total).

**Note:** Nemotron does not provide word-level timestamps. The `verbose_json` response includes a single segment covering the audio and the `words` array will be empty.

### TTS engines

Three TTS engines are available:

| Engine | `engine:` value | Voices | Sample rate | Downloads | Notes |
|--------|----------------|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| FluidAudio PocketTTS | `pocket_tts` | `alba` only | 24 kHz | ~200 MB on first start | Default |
| macOS AVSpeech | `avspeech` | 150+ system voices | 22050 Hz | None (ships with macOS) | Instant startup |
| FluidAudio Kokoro | `kokoro` | 50 voices, 8 languages | 24 kHz | ~300 MB on first start | High quality |

#### `pocket_tts` (default)

Uses [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio)'s PocketTTS model. Only the `alba` voice is available. Models are downloaded on first start and cached at `~/Library/Application Support/FluidAudio`.

#### `avspeech` — macOS built-in voices

Uses macOS's `AVSpeechSynthesizer` — no model downloads, instant startup, 150+ voices across dozens of languages. Audio is synthesised at 22050 Hz mono (16-bit PCM).

```yaml
tts:
  engine: avspeech
  avspeech:
    default_voice: Samantha   # Optional — nil uses the system locale default
```

List all available voices with:

```bash
say --voice '?'
```

The short name (e.g. `Samantha`, `Daniel`, `Karen`) is used in API requests. Voice names are case-insensitive; full identifiers (e.g. `com.apple.voice.enhanced.en-US.Samantha`) also work.

> **Note:** Siri voices are not accessible via public AVFoundation APIs and will not appear in the voice list.
> Personal Voice support (macOS 14+) is planned — see issue #13.

#### `kokoro` — FluidAudio Kokoro

Uses [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio)'s Kokoro CoreML model. 50 voices across 8 languages (American English, British English, Spanish, French, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, Mandarin Chinese), synthesised at 24 kHz. Models are downloaded on first start and cached at `~/.cache/fluidaudio/Models/kokoro`.

```yaml
tts:
  engine: kokoro
  kokoro:
    default_voice: af_heart   # Optional — default is af_heart (American English female)
```

American English voices (production-quality): `af_alloy`, `af_aoede`, `af_bella`, `af_heart`, `af_jessica`, `af_kore`, `af_nicole`, `af_nova`, `af_river`, `af_sarah`, `af_sky`, `am_adam`, `am_echo`, `am_eric`, `am_fenrir`, `am_liam`, `am_michael`, `am_onyx`, `am_puck`, `am_santa`.

Other language voices are experimental (not QA'd). Full voice list: use `/v1/audio/speech` with an invalid voice to see the available options listed in the error message, or query `GET /v1/models` via your client library.

### Config discovery order

1. `SPEECH_SERVER_CONFIG` environment variable (path to a YAML file)
2. `./speech-server.yaml` in the current working directory
3. Built-in defaults (no file needed)

```bash
# Use an explicit config file via env var
SPEECH_SERVER_CONFIG=/etc/speech-server.yaml swift run speech-server
```

### Environment variable overrides

Individual settings can also be overridden with environment variables:

| Variable | Overrides | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `HTTP_HOST` | `servers.http.host` | `HTTP_HOST=192.168.1.50` |
| `HTTP_PORT` | `servers.http.port` | `HTTP_PORT=9090` |
| `WYOMING_HOST` | `servers.wyoming.host` | `WYOMING_HOST=192.168.1.50` |
| `WYOMING_PORT` | `servers.wyoming.port` | `WYOMING_PORT=0` (disables Wyoming) |

Vapor's `--hostname` and `--port` CLI flags also work and take highest priority for the HTTP server.

## Deployment

This project supports two launchd deployment models:

| Model | Scope | Privileges | Persistence | Install script |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LaunchDaemon | System-wide | `sudo` required | Starts at boot, survives logout | `deploy/install-daemon.sh` |
| LaunchAgent | Per-user | No `sudo` | Starts at user login | `deploy/install-agent.sh` |

### Option A: LaunchDaemon (persistent system service)

Recommended when you want the server always available on the machine.

1. Build and install:

```bash
sudo deploy/install-daemon.sh
```

2. Verify status:

```bash
sudo launchctl print system/com.local.speech-server
```

3. Watch logs:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/speech-server/output.log /var/log/speech-server/error.log
```

What the installer does:
- Creates dedicated service account `_speech-server`.
- Installs binary to `/usr/local/bin/speech-server`.
- Installs config to `/etc/speech-server/speech-server.yaml` (without overwriting existing config).
- Installs LaunchDaemon plist to `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.local.speech-server.plist`.
- Optionally pre-populates FluidAudio cache from invoking user into the service account home.

Useful daemon commands:

```bash
# Restart daemon after config changes
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.local.speech-server

# Stop daemon
sudo launchctl bootout system/com.local.speech-server

# Start daemon again
sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.local.speech-server.plist
sudo launchctl enable system/com.local.speech-server
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.local.speech-server
```

Uninstall daemon:

```bash
# Keep config/logs/service user
sudo deploy/uninstall-daemon.sh

# Remove everything including config/logs/model cache/service user
sudo deploy/uninstall-daemon.sh --purge
```

### Option B: LaunchAgent (per-user service)

Recommended when you want user-session startup with no system-wide changes.

1. Build and install:

```bash
deploy/install-agent.sh
```

2. Verify status:

```bash
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.local.speech-server
```

3. Watch logs:

```bash
tail -f "$HOME/Library/Logs/speech-server/output.log" "$HOME/Library/Logs/speech-server/error.log"
```

Useful agent commands:

```bash
# Restart agent after config changes
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.local.speech-server

# Stop agent
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.local.speech-server

# Start agent again
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.local.speech-server.plist"
launchctl enable gui/$(id -u)/com.local.speech-server
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.local.speech-server
```

Uninstall agent:

```bash
# Keep config/logs
deploy/uninstall-agent.sh

# Remove user config/logs too
deploy/uninstall-agent.sh --purge
```

### Deployment files

The `deploy/` directory contains ready-to-use templates and scripts:

- `deploy/com.local.speech-server.plist` -- LaunchDaemon template
- `deploy/com.local.speech-server.agent.plist` -- LaunchAgent template (`__HOME__` placeholders are replaced by installer)
- `deploy/install-daemon.sh` and `deploy/uninstall-daemon.sh`
- `deploy/install-agent.sh` and `deploy/uninstall-agent.sh`

## API

All endpoints are available at both `/audio/*` and `/v1/audio/*` (OpenAI compatibility).

### Speech-to-Text

```
POST /v1/audio/transcriptions
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

| Field             | Type   | Required | Description                                       |
|-------------------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `file`            | File   | Yes      | Audio file (max 500 MB)                            |
| `model`           | String | No       | Model name (e.g. `whisper-1`)                      |
| `language`        | String | No       | ISO-639-1 language code                            |
| `prompt`          | String | No       | Context hint for transcription                     |
| `response_format` | String | No       | `json` (default), `text`, or `verbose_json`; `srt`/`vtt` return 400 |
| `temperature`     | Double | No       | Sampling temperature, 0.0-1.0                      |

Supported audio formats: WAV, MP3, M4A, FLAC, AIFF, OGG. Files without a recognised extension are identified automatically via magic bytes.

No API key is required. If your client sends an `Authorization` header it is silently ignored.

The `verbose_json` response includes a `segments` array and real `duration` from the ASR engine, matching the OpenAI API shape:

```json
{
  "task": "transcribe",
  "language": "en",
  "duration": 1.54,
  "text": "Hello world.",
  "segments": [{ "id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 1.54, "text": "Hello world.", ... }]
}
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F file=@recording.wav -F model=whisper-1

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F file=@recording.wav -F model=whisper-1 -F response_format=verbose_json
```

### Text-to-Speech

```
POST /v1/audio/speech
Content-Type: application/json
```

| Field             | Type   | Required | Description                                       |
|-------------------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `model`           | String | Yes      | Model name (e.g. `tts-1`)                          |
| `input`           | String | Yes      | Text to synthesize (max 4096 chars)                |
| `voice`           | String | No       | Voice name (default: engine default). See [TTS engines](#tts-engines). |
| `response_format` | String | No       | `wav` (default) or `pcm`                           |
| `speed`           | Double | No       | Playback speed, 0.25-4.0 (default: 1.0)           |

The response is **streamed**: audio begins arriving before synthesis is complete, sentence by sentence. WAV responses include a standard 44-byte header (with unknown-size placeholders) followed by 16-bit PCM; PCM responses are raw 16-bit bytes. The sample rate depends on the active TTS engine (24 kHz for `pocket_tts` and `kokoro`, 22050 Hz for `avspeech`).

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"tts-1","input":"Hello, world!"}' \
  --output speech.wav

# AVSpeech engine with a specific voice
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"tts-1","input":"Hello, world!","voice":"Samantha"}' \
  --output speech.wav
```

## Compatible apps

The HTTP API is compatible with any app or library that supports a configurable OpenAI base URL. No real API key is needed -- the server ignores `Authorization` headers, so enter any non-empty string.

### MacWhisper

[MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) has built-in support for custom transcription providers:

1. Open MacWhisper **Preferences**
2. Go to the **Provider** tab and choose **Custom**
3. Set the **API URL** to `http://<host>:<port>/v1/audio/transcriptions` (default `localhost:8080`)
4. Enter any string as the **API Key** (e.g. `local`)

Audio is sent directly to the endpoint; transcription happens entirely on-device with no round-trip to the cloud.

### Other apps

Any tool that supports a configurable OpenAI base URL should work out of the box: set the base URL to `http://<host>:<port>` (default `localhost:8080`) and use any string as the API key. This includes the official OpenAI Python and JavaScript SDKs, and similar tools.

## Accessing from other machines

By default the server binds to `127.0.0.1` and is only reachable locally. To serve requests from other devices -- another Mac, a phone, a Home Assistant instance -- bind to a reachable address and make sure the ports are accessible.

### Tailscale (recommended)

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) gives every device a stable private IP with no port-forwarding or firewall rules, and works across different networks (home, office, mobile). Both the HTTP API port and the Wyoming port are plain TCP; Tailscale handles encryption transparently.

**Recipe:**

1. Install Tailscale on the Mac running the server and on any device that needs access.
2. Note the Mac's Tailscale IP (e.g. `100.x.y.z`) from the menu-bar icon.
3. Bind the server to that IP in `speech-server.yaml`:

```yaml
servers:
  http:
    host: 100.x.y.z   # your Mac's Tailscale IP
  wyoming:
    host: 100.x.y.z   # your Mac's Tailscale IP
    port: 10300
```

4. Point your client at `http://100.x.y.z:8080` (HTTP API) or `100.x.y.z:10300` (Wyoming).

### Local network

Find your Mac's LAN IP in **System Settings > Network**, select your active connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet), and note the IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.50`). Bind the server to that address:

```yaml
servers:
  http:
    host: 192.168.1.50   # your Mac's LAN IP
  wyoming:
    host: 192.168.1.50   # your Mac's LAN IP
    port: 10300
```

Use that same IP in your client configuration. Note that LAN IPs can change when devices reconnect; consider assigning a DHCP reservation in your router, or use Tailscale for a stable address.

## Home Assistant

macos-speech-server speaks the [Wyoming protocol](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming), enabling fully on-device STT and TTS for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) voice pipelines via the [Wyoming integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wyoming/).

A single TCP port (default `10300`) handles both STT and TTS -- Home Assistant discovers both capabilities automatically.

### Network setup

Home Assistant typically runs on a separate machine, so the Wyoming port must be reachable from it. See [Accessing from other machines](#accessing-from-other-machines) above for Tailscale and LAN options -- in either case, set `servers.http.host` and `servers.wyoming.host` to your Mac's IP (or use the `HTTP_HOST` and `WYOMING_HOST` environment variables) so both ports are reachable from HA.

### Adding the Wyoming integration in Home Assistant

The integration must be added manually (zeroconf/auto-discovery is not supported):

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for **Wyoming Protocol**
4. Enter the host (IP address of the Mac running macos-speech-server) and port (default `10300`)
5. Home Assistant discovers both STT and TTS capabilities on that single port

### Using in a voice pipeline

1. Go to **Settings > Voice Assistants**
2. Create a new pipeline or edit an existing one
3. Select **macos-speech-server** for the Speech-to-text and/or Text-to-speech step

Streaming TTS (lower latency, audio starts playing before synthesis is complete) is supported in Home Assistant 2025.07 and later.
